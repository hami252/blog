    <h1> Hey everyone! </h1>
    <h3>Welcome to my first blog!</h3>
        <p> This blog is meant to be used as a personal accountability tool to help me track my progress. You will notice as the blog progresses that my blog posts will adapt and change as I learn more and more. </p>
        <p>Take this first post as an example of where I am starting my coding journey from. <strong> Square one</strong>. As you can see my site is simple. It doesn't have any of the fancy bells and whistles. I will continuously update my blog to show off my continous growth as I learn coding.</p>
    <h3>I am so glad to be able to share this journey with you. Please join along as I work towards my goal of becoming a proffessional programmer!</h3>
